# Arabic-Context-Dependent-Question-Answering-Dataset

Fifteen short Arabic stories are carefully selected from Youtube to be displayed for children of age 12-14 years in the
form of short videos in Android application called "Watch and Learn" - "شاهد وتعلم". Each story contains a set of prompts in the form of questions
that measure the understanding skill of the participants and their expression language. This process created 1550 responses. After filtering the invalid responses
,we eliminate 100 responses. The rest of responses,1450, are labeled as correct/incorrect in two dimensions; the meaning and the language.
